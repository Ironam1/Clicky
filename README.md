## Smash Bros. Memory

This application has been deployed with Github Pages and can be found here: https://ironam1.github.io/Clicky/

The Problem:

Use React to create a memory game application.

The Solution:

I chose Super Smash Bros. for my theme. Images are randomly displayed and will change with each click. A callback function handles the click event and checks if the image has been selected yet or not. 

I added react-animated-css to incorporate an NPM package.

For some reason that I do not know, my deployed application is a commit behind. New changes do not render.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
